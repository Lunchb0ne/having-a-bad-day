# 🐈 I'm Having A Really Really Bad Day

## Why?

>I'd like to counter this question by asking "Why not?"

To be honest, I just really wanted to hack around with Solid.

## Usage

Don't be a pleb and use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone it.

```bash
pnpm install # or npm install or yarn install
```

### This was hacked in a few hours using [Solid](https://solidjs.com)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `dev` or `start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
